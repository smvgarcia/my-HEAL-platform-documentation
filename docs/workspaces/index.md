# Workspace User Guide 

Workspaces are secure data analysis environments in the cloud that can access data from one or more data resources in the HEAL Data Ecosystem. By default, workspaces on the HEAL Data Platform include Jupyter notebooks, Python and R, but can be configured to host virtually any application, including analysis workflows, data processing pipelines, or data visualization tools.
