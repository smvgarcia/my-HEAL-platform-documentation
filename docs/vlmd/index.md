# Variable-level Metadata Submission 

Data Dictionaries, which contain variable-level metadata, describe each variable within a dataset. Examples of variable-level attributes include the variable name, description (or variable label), type, format, terminology, and source.

In order to submit a studyâ€™s data dictionary to the Platform, the data dictionary must conform to the HEAL [variable-level metadata schema](https://github.com/HEAL/heal-metadata-schemas/tree/main/variable-level-metadata-schema). The following instructions will demonstrate how to use the HEAL Data Utilities' VLMD tool to help you generate a HEAL-compliant data dictionary from your dataset or existing data dictionary.
